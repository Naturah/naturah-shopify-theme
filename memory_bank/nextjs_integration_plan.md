# NextJS + Shopify Integration Plan

## Requirements Analysis
- Convert traditional Shopify Liquid theme to headless approach with NextJS
- Maintain GitHub workflow for deployment
- Preserve existing theme components where possible
- Create a performant, modern e-commerce experience

## Architecture Considerations

### Headless Architecture

|               |       |                |       |                  |
| NextJS        | <---> | Shopify        | <---> | Customer Browser |
| Frontend      |       | Storefront API |       |                  |
|               |       |                |       |                  |
+---------------+       +----------------+       +------------------+
        ^                                                 ^
        |                                                 |
        v                                                 v
+---------------+                              +------------------+

| GitHub        | ----------------------->     | Hosting          |
| Repository    |     CI/CD Pipeline           | Environment      |
|               |                              |                  |
+---------------+                              +------------------+
```

## Components Affected
- Complete theme architecture (transition from Liquid to React/NextJS)
- Build pipeline and deployment workflow
- Data fetching approach (Shopify API vs Liquid)
- Asset management and optimization

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Configuration
1. Initialize NextJS application
2. Set up Shopify integration (Storefront API)
3. Configure build pipeline
4. Establish GitHub workflow

### Phase 2: Component Migration
1. Create NextJS component equivalents for existing Liquid components
2. Implement layout system with Next.js
3. Set up routing structure
4. Migrate styling approach (Tailwind CSS integration)

### Phase 3: Data Integration
1. Implement Shopify Storefront API integration
2. Create data fetching hooks/services
3. Implement state management
4. Set up authentication flow

### Phase 4: Deployment and CI/CD
1. Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD
2. Set up deployment to hosting environment
3. Implement preview environments
4. Establish testing framework

## Detailed Steps

### 1. NextJS Project Setup
```bash
# Create Next.js project
npx create-next-app@latest naturah-nextjs --typescript --tailwind --eslint

# Install Shopify dependencies
npm install @shopify/shopify-api @shopify/hydrogen-react
```

### 2. Shopify Storefront API Configuration
- Create Private App in Shopify Admin for API access
- Set up environment variables for API credentials
- Create API utility functions for data fetching

### 3. Component Structure
- `/components/product/` - Product-related components
- `/components/collection/` - Collection components
- `/components/layout/` - Layout components
- `/components/ui/` - Reusable UI components
- `/pages/` - Next.js route pages

### 4. Data Fetching Approach
- Implement Static Generation (SSG) for product and collection pages
- Use Incremental Static Regeneration for frequently updated content
- Client-side data fetching for dynamic content (cart, user-specific)

### 5. Deployment Configuration
- Configure GitHub Actions workflow
- Set up Vercel/Netlify integration or custom hosting
- Implement preview environments for pull requests

## Dependencies
- Next.js (React framework)
- Shopify Storefront API
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- GraphQL client (Apollo or SWR)
- Authentication solution (NextAuth.js, JWT)
- Testing framework (Jest, React Testing Library)

## Challenges & Mitigations

| Challenge | Mitigation |
|-----------|------------|
| SEO with headless approach | Implement proper metadata, SSG/ISR, sitemap generation |
| Performance impact | Optimize bundle size, implement code splitting, use Next.js image optimization |
| Shopify customization limitations | Identify which features need custom implementation vs. Shopify-managed |
| Cart synchronization | Implement robust client/server state management for cart |
| Preview environments | Set up dedicated preview store or mock data for development |

## Creative Phase Components
- UI/UX design adaptation for React components
- Cart implementation strategy
- Authentication flow design
- Performance optimization approach

## Next Steps
1. Set up NextJS project structure
2. Configure Shopify Storefront API integration
3. Create basic layout and component system
4. Implement product and collection pages
5. Set up GitHub Actions workflow

This plan provides a framework for transitioning from a traditional Shopify theme to a modern headless approach with NextJS while maintaining GitHub integration for workflow and deployment.
