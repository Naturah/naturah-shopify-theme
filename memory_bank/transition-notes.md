# Transition Notes: Next.js to Traditional Shopify Theme

This document outlines the transition from a headless Next.js architecture to a traditional Shopify theme using Liquid templates.

## Files Removed

The following Next.js-related files and directories have been removed as they are not used in a traditional Shopify theme approach:

### Directories
- ✅ `src/components/` - React components
- ✅ `src/context/` - React context providers
- ✅ `src/lib/` - API clients and utility functions for Next.js
- ✅ `src/pages/` - Next.js page components and API routes
- ✅ `src/config/` - Next.js configuration files
- ✅ `src/utils/` - Next.js utility functions
- ✅ `src/styles/` - Next.js global styles

### Files
- ✅ `.env.local` - Environment variables for Next.js
- ✅ `next.config.js` - Next.js configuration
- ✅ `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration

## Transition Plan

1. **Keep Tailwind CSS**: We'll continue to use Tailwind for styling
   - Keep `src/tailwind.css` and compile it to `assets/tailwind.css`

2. **✅ Remove Next.js Dependencies**: Updated package.json to remove Next.js-related dependencies

3. **Convert Pages to Liquid Templates**: 
   - Convert key Next.js pages to Liquid templates
   - Place them in the appropriate Shopify theme directories (templates/, sections/, snippets/)

4. **Implement Features with Liquid**:
   - User image uploads will be implemented using Shopify's native features or custom apps
   - Community gallery can be built with sections and metafields

## Feature Implementation Changes

### User Image Uploads
- Instead of using Next.js API routes, we can use:
  - Shopify's native file upload capabilities
  - A custom Shopify app if needed for more advanced functionality
  - Metafields to store user-generated content

### Community Gallery
- Instead of a React-based gallery:
  - Create a Liquid-based gallery section
  - Use Shopify's product collections or blog for organizing content
  - Implement with standard Shopify theme features

## Benefits of Traditional Approach

1. **Simplicity**: Easier to maintain and update
2. **Performance**: Native Shopify rendering is optimized
3. **Compatibility**: Works with all Shopify features out of the box
4. **Updates**: Easier to apply Shopify platform updates
5. **Learning Curve**: Requires less specialized knowledge

## Completed Steps

1. ✅ Removed all Next.js files and dependencies
2. ✅ Updated documentation to reflect traditional Shopify theme architecture
3. ✅ Configured Tailwind CSS for a traditional Shopify theme

## Next Steps

1. Complete the implementation of brand styles across all sections
2. Ensure all essential functionality is implemented in Liquid
3. Thoroughly test the theme
4. Deploy to Shopify
5. Document any additional custom functionality for future developers
